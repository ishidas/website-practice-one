#Helper
Terminal command you can use:
`$ ls` enter - list up all the files and directories(folders) in the current level
`$ ls -la` enter - will show you list of files and directories(folders) and hidden files and directories(folders)
`$ cd ./Applications `enter - will let you drill into ./Application meaning you are going into Application folder.
`$ cd ../` enter - will let you move up one level (so if you were in Applications folder, you should be back to where you started)
`$ clear` should clear all the stuff showed on the terminal if you want a fresh start

Google is your best friend :D there are almost always answers there! That's what everyone who is going into programming would be told, so here it is lol
