//1. create <div> element inside of <body>
//2. create <button> element inside of that div you created in step 1.
//3. Give the button element "id" called "changeColor"
//4. inside of this JS file, get the button element by id and add a click eventListener
//5. when a user clicks on the button, alert should pop up in the browser, and background color should change
//   to color of your choice.
//Bonus - you can also add a condition using "if else" statement.
//  condition is:  if the color of your choice is already used as background color,
//  change the background color back to white.
