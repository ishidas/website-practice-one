<!-- Step 5. Make sure command + s to save the changes you made. Go to your mac finder and find
website-practice-one folder and double click to go inside of the folder. you should be able to
double click index.html and should show your first Website on your browser!!
it's locally there no one else can see it so do the following commands in your terminal:

$ git add .                        => will add all the changes to git
$ git commit -m"first commit"      => comit is like a time stamp for your work. it's saving it locally.
$ git push origin master           => will push code up to github so I can pull down and see the code!

Congratulations! Your first step is done! Next up is add controlls using JS!
-->

<!--
  You want to make sure .js files are always at the bottom of the <body> tag becuase
  browser will read html page top to bottom, and we want to make sure all the html elements
  are available to controle before mounting the contoller. You need a car body done before
  wheeles, engines and gas are placed!
